# FINAL_CNN_FOREST 👨‍🔬🌳

The "FINAL_CNN_FOREST" project is a culmination of efforts to classify images as either "forest" 🌳 or "non-forest" 🏢 using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The objective is to build a robust machine learning system capable of accurately distinguishing between images containing forests and images without forests.

## Dataset 📚

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images that are divided into two classes: "forest" 🌳 and "non-forest" 🏢. The dataset has been preprocessed and split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the images used for training and 20% for testing.

## Neural Network Architecture 🧠

The chosen architecture for the CNN model is designed to effectively capture relevant features from the input images. It comprises multiple convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions. The output from the last convolutional layer is flattened and connected to a fully connected layer, which is then linked to the output layer using a softmax activation function for classification.

## Training ⚙️

The training process involves feeding the labeled training images through the CNN model and adjusting the model's internal parameters to minimize the classification error. The optimization algorithm employed is stochastic gradient descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 32.

The model is trained over a specified number of epochs, iterating through the training set. At each epoch, the model computes the loss between its predicted outputs and the true labels, and then performs backpropagation to update the model's parameters.

## Evaluation 📊

Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated using the labeled testing images. Various evaluation metrics are utilized, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to accurately classify images containing forests.

## Dependencies 🛠️

To run the code for this project, the following dependencies are required:

- Python (version >= 3.6) 🐍
- TensorFlow (version >= 2.0) 🧠
- Keras (version >= 2.0) 🌟
- NumPy (version >= 1.0) 🔢
- Matplotlib (version >= 3.0) 📊

Ensure these dependencies are installed in your environment before running the code.

## Usage 🚀

To use the "FINAL_CNN_FOREST" project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
3. Organize your dataset by placing the images into separate folders for "forest" 🌳 and "non-forest" 🏢 classes.
4. Update the paths to the training and testing datasets in the code.
5. Execute the code to train the model and evaluate its performance.

```bash
python final_cnn_forest.py
```

## Results 📈

After training and evaluation, the model achieved an accuracy of 92% on the testing set. The precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to be 0.91, 0.93, and 0.92, respectively. These results indicate that the model performs well in differentiating between forest and non-forest images.

## Further Improvements 🌟

To further enhance the classification performance of the "FINAL_CNN_FOREST" model, consider the following improvements:

- Data augmentation: Increase the diversity of the dataset by applying random transformations to the images, such as rotations, flips, and zooms. This can help the model generalize better.
- Transfer learning: Utilize pre-trained CNN models, such as VGG or ResNet, and fine-tune them on the forest vs. non-forest classification task. This can leverage the learned features from large-scale image datasets.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameter settings, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs, to optimize the model's performance.
- Error analysis: Analyze misclassified images to identify common patterns or challenges that the model struggles with. This analysis can provide insights for further improvements.

By incorporating these enhancements, the "FINAL_CNN_FOREST" model's accuracy and overall performance can potentially be improved.
